# Web: Springboot WAR

This sample describes how to use Spring Boot to build a WAR Archive (.war). 
The WAR contains a GET endpoint **"springboot-war/test"**, which returns "Hello, TIBCO!" when 
gets called. The resulting archive can be used in a downstream EventFlow fragment.

## Create a GET endpoint

Add the following maven dependencies into the pom.xml. 
Since runtime node web server is an embedded Jetty web server, the
 **org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-tomcat** must be 
excluded from **org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web**, and 
**org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jetty** has to be added with the **provided** scope.

```xml

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.1.RELEASE</version>
            <exclusions>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
                <exclusion>
                    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-logging</artifactId>
                </exclusion>
            </exclusions>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
            <version>2.2.1.RELEASE</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

The [sample java code folder](../../../main/java/com/tibco/ep/samples/web/springboot/springbootwar)([html](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/tibco-streaming-samples/tree/master/web/websocket/websocket-war/src/main/java/com/tibco/ep/samples/web/springboot/springbootwar)) 
provides a GET endpoint to response "Hello, TIBCO!" when gets called.

## Generate WAR archive

The project's packaging type is **war**.
```xml
    <groupId>com.tibco.ep.samples.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>springboot-war</artifactId>
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    <version>1.0.0</version>

```
The [maven war plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/) 
is used to build the WAR archive (.war).  The following maven build rule is used:

```xml
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.2.3</version>
            <configuration>
                <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
```
