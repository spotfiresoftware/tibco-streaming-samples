# Web : Prometheus Metrics - WAR

This sample describes how to expose TIBCO&reg; Streaming node metrics as a Prometheus consumable
REST endpoint.

## Initialize the servlet

See [PrometheusExporterServlet.java](../../main/java/com/tibco/ep/samples/prometheus/PrometheusExporterServlet.java)

The main initialization method consists in registering the internal metrics in the Prometheus 
collector registry.

```xml
    <groupId>com.tibco.ep.samples.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>prometheus-metrics-war</artifactId>
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
```
