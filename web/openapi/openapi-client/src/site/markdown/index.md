# Web : web client generation with OpenAPI Code Generation tool

This sample describes how to use the OpenAPI Code Generation tool to generate a Health check web client 
from OpenAPI specification yaml file by using OpenAPI Code Generation tool.  The generated web client 
is in Java and supported by Jersey framework.  It can be used for building requests or accessing the 
response from the Streaming node server Health check web service.

## Add Health check web service OpenAPI specification YAML file 

Add Health check web service OpenAPI specification YAML file 

A web service OpenAPI specification YAML file need to be provided and used as the template to
generate web client. In this example, we uses the Streaming node server [Health check web service
OpenAPI specification YAML file](../../main/resources/HealthCheck-REST-API-Definition.yaml)

## Add the required maven plugin and dependencies

The [openapi-generator-maven-plugin](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openapitools/openapi-generator-maven-plugin) 
is used to support this OpenAPI generator project. The following maven build rule is used:
```xml
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openapitools</groupId>
        <artifactId>openapi-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>4.3.0</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <goals>
                    <goal>generate</goal>
                </goals>
                <configuration>
                    <!-- specify the OpenAPI yaml -->
                    <inputSpec>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/HealthCheck-REST-API-Definition.yaml</inputSpec>
                    <!-- target to generate java client code -->
                    <generatorName>java</generatorName>
                    <!-- override the default library to jersey2 -->
                    <library>jersey2</library>
                    <output>${project.build.directory}/generated-sources</output>
                    <apiPackage>${default.package}.handler</apiPackage>
                    <modelPackage>${default.package}.model</modelPackage>
                    <invokerPackage>${default.package}.handler</invokerPackage>
                    <generateApiTests>false</generateApiTests>
                    <generateModelTests>false</generateModelTests>
                    <!-- pass any necessary config options -->
                    <configOptions>
                        <dateLibrary>java11</dateLibrary>
                    </configOptions>
                </configuration>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>    
```

Add the required maven dependencies for the client being generated.
