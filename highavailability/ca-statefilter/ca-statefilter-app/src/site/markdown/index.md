## Machines and nodes

In this sample we name the machines as **A**,  which hosts the StreamBase node **A**, 
and **B**, which hosts the StreamBase node **B**.

## Define the node deployment configuration

This sample uses no special node deployment configurations, so node deployment configuration
file is not required.

<a name="design-notes"></a>

## Design notes

* The event flow fragment defines that only one state filter operator is running in the cluster

<a name="failure-scenarios"></a>

## Failure scenarios

The main failure cases for this deployment are outlined below :

Failure case   | Behavior on failure | Steps to resolve | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Machine A fails | State filter operator on node B is automatically started  | 1 Fix machine A<br/>2 Use **epadmin install node** and **epadmin start node**<br/>3 Note that the operator remains running on node B | 1 No data loss<br/>2 No service loss
Machine B fails | No impact | 1 Fix machine B<br/>2 Use **epadmin install node** and **epadmin start node** | 1 No data loss<br/>2 No service loss

With a 2 node configuration node quorums don't apply hence a multi-master scenario is possible on network failure.
Multiple network paths ( such as network bonding ) is recommended.

## Building this sample from the command line and running the integration test cases

In this sample, some HA integration test cases are defined in the pom.xml that :

* start nodes A & B
* use **epadmin display operator** to check the operator status on both nodes ( state filter operator is started on node A only )
* stop node A
* use **epadmin display operator** to check the operator status on both nodes ( state filter operator is now started on node B )
* stop node B

**Warning:** This does not constitute an exhaustive non-functional test plan

Use [maven](https://maven.apache.org) as **mvn install** to build from the command line or Continuous Integration system :
